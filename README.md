# GeneralCXXTemplate
An all encompassing C++ Project template file structure for my needs. It allows the addition of 
Libraries, Google Test as well as Boost with CMake and CPack

# Description
This is a general C++ template project structure. It comes with auto
documentation, automated testing (using gtest) and CMake
to help with the execution.

init_documentation.sh is used to create the documentation automatically
run_all.sh is used to run all tests and program execution, as well as to create the necessary documentation
run_application.sh is used to run only the application
run_tests.sh is used to run only the tests
